Stainless consists of several sbt projects.

The core verifier sources are in `core/src/scala`.

There is a front end for Scala 3, as well as an sbt plugin (which also compiles and eliminates ghost code).

The documentation from user's point of view is in `core/src/sphinx`.

This directory also contains release notes and release instructions.
