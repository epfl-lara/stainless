  /*
   * Allows the user to manually define the implementation for a C function.
   *
   * The optional parameters `headerIncludes` and `cIncludes` can hold a
   * colon separated list of include header files.
   *
   * For convenience, the C implementation generated by ``code`` is represented
   * using a String and not an Abstract Syntax Tree. The user is responsible
   * for the correctness of the provided C99 code. Because GenC might rename
   * the function, e.g. to deal with overloading, the special ``__FUNCTION__``
   * token should be used instead of the original name. Furthermore, the
   * parameters and return type should match the signature automatically
   * generated by GenC.
   *
   * Note that this annotation doesn't imply @extern but they can be
   * combined if needed.
   *
   * Example:
   * --------
   *
   *    // Print a 32-bit integer using the *correct*
   *    // format for printf in C99
   *    @cCode.function(
   *      code = """
   *        |void __FUNCTION__(int32_t x) {
   *        |  printf("%"PRIi32, x);
   *        |}
   *        """,
   *      headerIncludes = "inttypes.h:stdio.h",
   *      cIncludes = ""
   *    )
   *    def myprint(x: Int): Unit = {
   *      print(x)
   *    }
   *
   *
   * TODO in a later stage, when generics are supported, the instanciated type
   *      should be given to `code` somehow.
   *
   * NOTE As of April 2016, static annotation only supports literal parameters.
