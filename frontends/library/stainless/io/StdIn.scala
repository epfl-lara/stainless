/*
 * NOTEs for GenC:
 * --------------
 *
 *  - `stainless.io.State` should be completely ignored as it is an artefact for verification
 *    proofs. TODO It might be interesting to completely drop it from the C code
 *    instead of aliasing it to void* and the null pointer.
 *
 *  - While `bool` is a standard C99 type (aliased to `_Bool`), there is no specifier
 *    for scan operation. Additionnally, the actual size of a boolean is platform
 *    dependent. Therefore, for simplicity, `readBoolean` is currently dropped.
 *
 *  - Currently, GenC doesn't support `BigInt` which implies that `readBigInt` is
 *    dropped as well.
 *
 *  - In order to handle errors (e.g. EOF or invalid formatting), the API has to be
 *    updated. One solution would be to return `Option`s. Another would be to use
 *    exception, however this is probably trickier to translate to C.
 *
 *  - Decisions regarding those issues should be applied to FileInputStream as well.
 *
 *
 * FIXME Using the `scala.io.StdIn.read*` methods has a major shortcomming:
 *       the data is read from a entire line!

     *
     * NOTE
     *  - The `%d` flag is for signed decimal integers;
     *  - The format of the number is the same as expected by strtol() with the value 10 for the base argument;
     *  - This format corresponds to the following regex:
     *
     *              \s*[+-]?\d+
     *
     *    where
     *      - `\s` match any character c such that `isspace(c)` holds;
     *      - a negative number (indicated by a leading `-`) is negated using the unary `-` operator;
     *  - If the converted value falls out of range of 32-bit integers, either Int.MaxValue or Int.MinValue is returned;
     *  - Note that reading the "-MaxValue" is undefined behaviour in C, and so is it in this implementation;
     *  - If the input doesn't match an integer then no input is consumed.
