[ Error  ] IllegalAliasing.scala:9:13: Illegal aliasing: Mut[S](a)
[ Error  ] Hint: this error occurs due to:
[ Error  ]   -the type of b (Mut[S]) being mutable
[ Error  ]   -the definition of b not being fresh
[ Error  ]   -the definition of b containing variables of mutable types
[ Error  ]   that also appear after the declaration of b:
[ Error  ]     -a (of type S)
[ Error  ]
               val b = Mut(a)
