[ Error  ] MutateInside11.scala:14:15: Illegal aliasing: Mut[Thing[Int]](thing)
[ Error  ] Hint: this error occurs due to:
[ Error  ]   -the type of mut (Mut[Thing[Int]]) being mutable
[ Error  ]   -the definition of mut not being fresh
[ Error  ]   -the definition of mut containing variables of mutable types
[ Error  ]   that also appear after the declaration of mut:
[ Error  ]     -thing (of type Thing[Int])
[ Error  ]
               val mut = Mut(thing)
                         ^^^^^^^^^^
