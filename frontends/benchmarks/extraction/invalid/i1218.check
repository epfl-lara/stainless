[ Error  ] i1218.scala:6:16: Illegal aliasing: arr.updated(1, B(42))
[ Error  ] Hint: this error occurs due to:
[ Error  ]   -the type of arr2 (Array[B]) being mutable
[ Error  ]   -the definition of arr2 not being fresh
[ Error  ]   -the definition of arr2 containing variables of mutable types
[ Error  ]   that also appear after the declaration of arr2:
[ Error  ]     -arr (of type Array[B])
[ Error  ]
               val arr2 = arr.updated(1, B(42))
