  /*
   * The Science of Programming from David Gries Section 20.1
   
   * The goal is to justify a text. We are given a list of indices corresponding
   * to the columns of the starting point of each word. Each words are already
   * separated by one space. The parameter s is the additional number of spaces
   * at the end of the line that we will need to add between words. We
   * want the number of space on the same line to differ by at most one.
   *
   * If we denote by p and q the two number of spaces between words (p and q differ
   * only by 1), then we want to only switch once the number of space between words
   * on the line. This means that we first separate words using p, then we do it using
   * q until the end of the line. 
   *
   * z is the line number, the rule is for odd line number to have more spaces on the right (q=p+1)
   * and for even line number to have more spaces on the left (p=q+1). We do not want trailing
   * spaces.
   *
   * n is the number of words on the line.
   *
   * If we apply this justify to each line of a text separately, this should lead to a good looking
   * justified text.

   * Here is an example:
   *
   * justifying lines by
   * inserting extra blanks is
   * one task of a text editor.
   *
   * results in:
   *
   * justifying     lines     by
   * inserting extra  blanks  is
   * one  task of a text editor.
