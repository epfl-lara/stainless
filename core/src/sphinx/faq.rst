Below we collect answers to some questions that came up.

Proving properties of size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I have defined a size function on my algebraic data type.

.. code-block:: scala

  sealed abstract class List
  case class Cons(head: Int, tail: List) extends List
  case object Nil extends List
  def size(l: List) : Int = (l match {
    case Nil => 0
    case Cons(_, t) => 1 + size(t)
  }) ensuring(_ >= 0)

Stainless neither proves nor gives a counterexample. Why?

**Answer:** You should consider using `BigInt`, which
denotes unbounded mathematical integers, instead of `Int`,
which denotes 32-bit integers. If you replace `Int` with
`BigInt` in the result type of `size`, the function should
verify. Note that algebraic data types can be arbitrarily
large, so, if the input list had the size `Int.MaxValue + 1`
(which is 2^32) then the addition `1 + size(t)` would wrap
around and produce `Int.MinValue` (that is, -2^31), so the
`ensuring` clause would not hold.

Compiling Stainless programs to bytecode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you don't use special constructs such as ``choose`` or ``forall``, you
should be able to compile Stainless programs to `.class` using `scalac` and
execute them directly on the JVM, or integrate them as part as other
Scala-based projects.

Beware that you need to explicitly include files from the Stainless library
(that are implicitly bundled when you use the `./stainless` script):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir out
    $ scalac $(find path/to/stainless/library/ -name "*.scala" | xargs) MyFile.scala -d out
