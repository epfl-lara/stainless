/**
 * Process the extracted units.
 *
 * Frontends are required to follow this workflow (== one cycle):
 *  - when starting extracting compilation unit, [[beginExtractions]] should be called once;
 *  - the [[CallBack.apply]] method after extracting each compilation unit (i.e. a Scala file);
 *  - the [[CallBack.failed]] method if the compilation unit extraction failed (or it contained errors);
 *  - finally, the frontend calls [[endExtractions]] to let the CallBack know all the data
 *    should be available by now.
 *
 * When a compilation unit is recompiled, the callback deals with any potential invalidation of
 * existing data without blocking the callee's thread.
 *
 * A [[Frontend]] has to [[stop]] or [[join]] its callback at some point between two cycles.
 * A callback cannot be reused after calling [[stop]].
 *
 * Calling [[getReport]] is valid exclusively after [[join]]ing and before the next cycle starts.
 *
 * A callback is expected to be used by only one frontend at a time.
