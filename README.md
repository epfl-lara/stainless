# Stainless [![Release][release-img]][latest-release] [![Nightly Build Status][nightly-larabot-img]][nightly-larabot-ref] [![Build Status][larabot-img]][larabot-ref] [![Gitter chat][gitter-img]][gitter-ref] [![Apache 2.0 License][license-img]][license-ref]

Verification framework for a subset of the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) programming language.
Supports contract-driven verification as well as termination checking of higher-order
functional programs with local imperative features (see [Pure Scala](https://epfl-lara.github.io/stainless/purescala.html)
and [Imperative](https://epfl-lara.github.io/stainless/imperative.html)
for more details about the supported fragment).

## Development

To build the project, run `sbt universal:stage`. If all goes well, a binary gets generated: `frontends/scalac/target/universal/stage/bin/stainless-scalac`. More information is available in the documentation links.

### Relation to [Inox](https://github.com/epfl-lara/inox)

Stainless relies on Inox to solve the various queries stemming from program verification.
Inox supports model-complete queries in a feature-rich fragment that lets Stainless focus
on program transformations and soundness of both contract and termination checking.

### Relation to [Leon](https://github.com/epfl-lara/leon)

The Stainless/Inox stack has grown out of the Leon codebase and subsumes the verification and
termination checking features of Leon. The new projects aim to provide a more stable and
principled implementation of the verification techniques underlying Leon. Feature-wise,
Stainless has already outgrown Leon verification and provides new features such as higher-order
contracts and contract-based termination checking.
